- default prop on model not working correctly
- model.ts file needs to be refactored
- server side rendering endpoints
- review sockets
- Either remove BaseController or find a reason for it to exist
- look into refactoring the way required fields work in endpoints (big if)
- look into code generation from models (generating CRUD's)
- look into possibility of making endpoint multi threaded.
- look into automatic tests.
